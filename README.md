# group.sniper.
Discord bot based on @S55 code, modified to look like a discord bot

The purpose of this bot is to find abandoned groups in roblox, their value is that the groups are paid and cost as much as 100 robux.
With strong luck, you can get a group even with a fund that can contain robux!

the bot works like this - when you enter the ~start-generate command, it starts a special cycle - generating a random id, checking it to see if the group has an owner, or if it is abandoned. If it is abandoned and not closed, it sends the results to the chat.
It is quite slow due to the fact that it does not use proxies. (I honestly tried to add them, but the proxies constantly could not connect to the roblox API tunnel.)
If you could improve the bot for the better - you can share your repositories on my discord server, or in the forum of my repository, thanks :3
